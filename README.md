# SMSA-App

Welcome! 
This is a simple, completely native iOS Application, built for our parish (St. Mary and St. Athanasius Coptic Orthodox Church in Northridge, CA).

This application is written in Swift 5.0, and built with the iOS 13 SDK. It's also free to use and modify for any other non-profit organizations.

# Features
## RSS Feed Parsing
This is a pretty-self explanatory one. Our application can parse RSS feeds and display them in-app. It can also aggregate multiple RSS feeds into one "feed". We've built it specifically for Squarespace RSS feeds, so it also can filter the entries in the feed by tag (if using Squarespace). This enables people to filter all the entries of the feed to only the ones they care about. 

## iCal Parsing
This app has a simple and efficient iCal Parser that displays Calendar events within the app. Note: the repeating event logic is still being tweaked, but this works great for one-time events!

## Built-In Podcast Player
We also have a built-in podcast player for podcast RSS feeds, so users can listen without having to leave the app. We use this for recorded sermons from the Sunday services. The podcast player supports all modern iOS features including support for lockscreen controls and Airplay.

## Live Stream Viewer
This app also have the ability to view YouTube live-streams. This is done natively by using the iOS Video Player, and is all done in-app.

## Compatibility
This app is fully compatible with iOS 13, and of course, supports the snazzy new system-wide dark mode. Good news in dark times.

# Roadmap
In the future, we plan to add calendar and announcement filtering to allow users to only see what matters to them. We also plan to add opt-in notifications. And lastly, we plan to hit the Google Play store soon!
